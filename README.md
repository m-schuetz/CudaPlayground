"Kuhda Ball Pit VR" - A Global Game Jam project by Philipp Erler and Markus Sch√ºtz.

* Tech demo that uses CUDA for rendering, PhysX for the ball pit simulation, and SteamVR for VR-controller interaction (cows = VR controllers). 
* A very unoptimized prototype, currently gets 200fps on an RTX 4090.

Once VR rendering also works, we'll update the documentation.
